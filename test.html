				Hello. This article will introduce you on the basic guidelines of web typography. A collection of simple concepts that only takes a few lines of CSS to implement. Please note that this is just a guide to help you achieve better readability and not to be taken religiously. Feel free to implement your own idea if you'd like to showcase a unique look or for just fun experimentation.
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>Paragraphs</code> should be short and sweet. Make it approachable and easily digestible. The <code>line-height</code> and <code>margin-bottom</code> property will provide breathing room and space for your paragraphs. Setting the line-height value of at least 1.4 should be enough (this should scale-up depending on your font-size).
