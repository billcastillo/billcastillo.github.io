			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Hello. This article will introduce you on the basic guidelines of web typography. A collection of simple concepts that only takes a few lines of <code>CSS</code> to implement. Please note that this is just a guide to help you achieve better readability and not to be taken religiously. Feel free to implement your own idea if you'd like to showcase a unique look or for just fun experimentation.</p>
			<p>
			To help you understand the difference, this page will serve as a interactive demo while we go each through of the guides.</p>

			<p>Before we start, let's move a bit from the browser's edge, shall we?</p>

			<p>Click the button at the <em>bottom right</em> of the page to implement style guides on this page.</p>

			<h2>Visual Heirarchy</h2>
			<p>Implementing a proper structure heirarchy on your page will already show a significant impact on its readability. This will show what needs to be emphasized; and to guide users on the overall composition of the page.</p>

			<p>In order to do this, let's break down the containing elements:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Header</li>
				<li>Paragraphs</li>
				<li>Images</li>
				<li>Lists</li>
				<li>Quotes / Blockquotes</li>
				<li>Etc.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Headers</h3>
			<p><code>Headers</code> or <code>headings</code> are the most important part an article. A sub-heading, just like a paragraph, are used to seperate different ideas, and subsections of the same topic. The HTML nodes from <code>h1</code> to <code>h6</code> should be used for the relevant contexts.</p>

<pre>
	<code>
	<h1>Heading 1</h1>
	<h2>Heading 2</h2>
	<h3>Heading 3</h3>
	<h4>Heading 4</h4>
	<h5>Heading 5</h5>
	<h6>Heading 6</h6>
  </code>
</pre>

			<p>Using <code>CSS</code>, you can implement different <code>font-size</code> for each node. Using ratio of 1.4, I was able to have a modular scale for my headers.</p>

<pre>
	<code>
	h1 { font-size: 5.378em; }
	h2 { font-size: 3.842em; }
	h3 { font-size: 2.744em; }
	h4 { font-size: 1.96em; }
	h5 { font-size: 1.40em; }
	h6 { font-size: 1.00em; }
	</code>
</pre>
			
			<p>Headers also serves as a guide for Google, Yahoo, Bing, and other search engines to read or <code>crawl</code> your website to analyze its content and  rank it according to relevance. So, if you'd like an additional <code>SEO</code> boosts, I insist you use the proper HTML5 semantics.</p>

			<h3>Paragraph</h3>
			<p><code>Paragraphs</code> should be short and sweet. Make it approachable and easily digestible. The <code>line-height</code> and <code>margin-bottom</code> property will provide breathing room and space for your paragraphs. Setting the line-height value of at least 1.4 should be enough (this should scale-up depending on your font-size). </p>

<pre>
	<code class="css">
	p {
	  font-size: 1em; // 16px
	  line-height: 1.4;
	  margin-bottom: 1.4em;
	}
	</code>
</pre>

				<h2>Containers</h2>
				<p>A proper composure for your page layout also plays an important role for readability. Keeping the <code>container</code> to an optimal length that should ease the eye movements of the reader.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Too wide</b> - if the line is too long, the reader will have a hard time focusing on the text.</li> 
					<li><b>Too short</b> - a short line could break the reader's rhythm and might even cause stress.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>One pointer is to keep it between 50―70 characters per line. So, using the most common font-sizes of 16―22 pixels, you might end up between 500―750 pixels.</p>

				<p>If you're on mobile though, the width will stay at 100%.</p>

				<h2>Fonts &amp; Colors</h2>

				<h3>Fonts</h3>
				<p>An optional but highly recommended part of typography. This is where your creative juice comes to play! Usually, it is adviced that you only use a variety of 3 or less fonts. Too many might add confusion and clutter your reader's visual perception. More fonts would also rack-up the loading time of your page.</p>

				<p>This demo used <em>Droid Sans</em>―<code>serif</code> font and <em>Merriweather Sans</em>―<code>sans-serif</code> font.</p>
				<p>You are free to select your own combinations or pair. See and feel which fonts would create a perfect harmony.</p>
				
				<h3>Colors</h3>
				<p>You might not notice the difference in color when you clicked that button but I assure you even just a little, I did a small relief on your eyes by optimizing the contrast between the <code>font-color</code> and the <code>background-color</code>.</p>
				
				<p>Instead of using pure black <code>#000000</code>, I've added a bit of grey to the body by using <code>#363636</code> for the paragraph and <code>#202020</code> for the headers.</p>

				<p>And that's the basic guideline of readability - a readable contrast. However, you can use any color of your preference on your article. Should it be your theme, custom color palette or just any color that fits your style. <em>As long as it has a proper contrast ratio.</em> Enough to be readable.</p>

				<h2>Additional tidbits</h2>

				<p>Adding tasty details might not be your thing but it is a welcome one. These mini-snippets on your CSS can define your style and uniqueness to your blog and/or article. A simple underline, or a border can add even more emphasis to your message.</p>
